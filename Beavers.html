    <h1>The human attempted to get to the throne...but King Beaver (KB) was already there. He was defeated and banned.</h1>
    <p>KB waited on choosing his side-king/advisors; something new.</p>
    <p>But it turned out to be smart and he picked the best advisors and only very late did he make PY side-king.</p>
    <p>He developed a great kingdom, while TM tried to overcome the beavers. So far he is failing...but legend has it that he will come back and join the beavers.</p>
